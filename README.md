# JavaScript Foundations

This is the code base I use for my YouTube Channel. It contains files that have questions and answers. The reason for the Q&A format is to logically teach JavaScript ES6 in a well organized format. During the instructional videos I do not type out the questions but use them as the basis for instructions. Here, interested parties not only get the code used in the videos, but the Q&A session I use to help them better understand the code and its use.
